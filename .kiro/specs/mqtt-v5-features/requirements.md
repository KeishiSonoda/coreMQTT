# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for adding MQTT v5.0 protocol support to the coreMQTT library. The MQTT v5.0 protocol introduces several new features and enhancements over MQTT v3.1.1, including improved error reporting, message expiry, topic aliases, and more. This implementation will extend the existing coreMQTT library to support these new features while maintaining backward compatibility with MQTT v3.1.1.

The implementation will follow the official MQTT v5.0 specification as defined by OASIS: https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/mqtt-v5.0.html

Key motivations for transitioning to MQTT v5.0 include:
1. Support for Matter protocol
2. Providing customers with a robust alternative to other MQTT v5.0 implementations like wolfMQTT
3. Improved security, reliability, and error reporting capabilities

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize an MQTT v5.0 context with support for ACK properties, so that I can use MQTT v5.0 features while maintaining backward compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing an MQTT context THEN the system SHALL support an additional parameter for an ACK properties buffer
2. WHEN the ACK properties buffer is provided THEN the system SHALL use it for crafting packets with user properties
3. WHEN the ACK properties buffer is not provided THEN the system SHALL function as a standard MQTT v3.1.1 client

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use a property builder pattern for MQTT v5.0 properties in the CONNECT packet, so that I can easily configure connection properties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a CONNECT packet THEN the system SHALL provide a property builder API for adding properties
2. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support setting session expiry interval
3. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support setting receive maximum
4. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support setting maximum packet size
5. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support setting topic alias maximum
6. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support setting request response information
7. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support setting request problem information
8. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support adding user properties
9. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support setting authentication method
10. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support setting authentication data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use a property builder pattern for MQTT v5.0 properties in the PUBLISH packet, so that I can leverage advanced publishing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a PUBLISH packet THEN the system SHALL provide a property builder API for adding properties
2. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support setting payload format indicator
3. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support setting message expiry interval
4. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support setting topic alias
5. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support setting response topic
6. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support setting correlation data
7. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support adding user properties
8. WHEN using the property builder THEN the system SHALL support setting content type

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to process ACK packets with reason codes, so that I can handle server responses appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving ACK packets (CONNACK, PUBACK, PUBREC, PUBREL, PUBCOMP, SUBACK, UNSUBACK) THEN the system SHALL parse and expose reason codes
2. WHEN receiving ACK packets THEN the system SHALL parse and expose reason strings if present
3. WHEN receiving ACK packets THEN the system SHALL parse and expose user properties if present
4. WHEN receiving SUBACK or UNSUBACK packets THEN the system SHALL parse and expose reason codes for each topic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to process incoming PUBLISH packets with user properties, so that I can access custom metadata in messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a PUBLISH packet THEN the system SHALL provide an API to iterate through user properties
2. WHEN processing user properties THEN the system SHALL provide access to both the key and value of each property
3. WHEN iterating through properties THEN the system SHALL indicate when there are no more properties to process

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to respond to incoming PUBLISH packets with reason codes and properties, so that I can provide detailed feedback to publishers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing an incoming PUBLISH THEN the system SHALL allow setting a reason code for the acknowledgment
2. WHEN acknowledging a PUBLISH THEN the system SHALL support adding a reason string to the acknowledgment
3. WHEN acknowledging a PUBLISH THEN the system SHALL support adding user properties to the acknowledgment

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the new MQTT v5.0 AUTH packet type, so that I can implement enhanced authentication mechanisms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing authentication THEN the system SHALL support sending and receiving AUTH packets
2. WHEN using AUTH packets THEN the system SHALL support setting authentication method and authentication data
3. WHEN processing AUTH packets THEN the system SHALL provide reason codes to the application

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure backward compatibility with MQTT v3.1.1 applications, so that I can upgrade to MQTT v5.0 with minimal code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the library without MQTT v5.0 specific features THEN the system SHALL behave identically to the MQTT v3.1.1 implementation
2. WHEN upgrading from MQTT v3.1.1 THEN the system SHALL allow applications to gradually adopt MQTT v5.0 features
3. WHEN using MQTT v5.0 features THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation on how to use them
